## Hugo (the main page)

## Getting Started
[https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)

Navigate to "prebuilt binaries" or
[https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)

Choose the "hugo_extended" version for your OS, download, and unzip it.

I moved this to the Desktop and renamed it just "hugo" for simplicity

Then you can add to PATH with

export PATH=$PATH:~/Desktop/hugo/

(May need to RESTART your terminal if there are issues)
